# Calculator-Tkinter
A simple graphical calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. This calculator handles basic arithmetic operations and includes features for clearing the display, performing calculations, and correcting input.

1. Features
* Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
* Special Operations: Includes buttons for pi approximation (*3.14), percentage (%), exponentiation (**), squaring (**2), and parentheses for complex expressions.
* Clear All (AC): Instantly clears the entire display for new input.
* Undo (<-): Removes the last entered character, useful for correcting mistakes.
* Error Handling: Displays "ERROR" for invalid expressions.
* Intuitive Layout: A clean and easy-to-use button layout.

2. How to Run
* Get the calculator.py file: Download the calculator.py from this repository
* Ensure Python is installed: You need Python installed on your computer to run this application. Tkinter, which this calculator uses for its graphical interface, is typically included with standard Python installations, so no additional setup should be required.
* Run the file: Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you saved the calculator.py file.

3. How to Use
* Once you run the calculator.py file, a small calculator window will appear.
* Numbers: Click the number buttons (0-9) to enter digits into the display.
* Operations: Click the operator buttons (+, -, *, /, %, **, *3.14, (, )) to insert operations.
* Clear (AC): Click the "AC" button to clear all input from the display.
* Undo (<-): Click the "<-" button to delete the last character entered.
* Calculate (=): Click the "=" button to evaluate the expression currently in the display. The result will then appear in the display.
* Error: If an invalid expression is entered, "ERROR" will be displayed. Use "AC" to clear it.
